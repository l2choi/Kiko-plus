Some info about the guy behind this site:

* I graduated from the Computer Engineering program at the University of Waterloo, class of 2017.
* I write stuff.
* If I'm not writing, I'm probably around somewhere.
* I read up on a lot of things: tech, politics, world events, etc.
* I can either be very talkative or not at all.
* I prefer solitude over big crowds, but I'm not a complete introvert.
