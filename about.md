### About

Some info about the guy behind this site:

* I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

* I write stuff.

* If I'm not writing, I'm probably around somewhere.

* I read up on a lot of things: tech, politics, world events, etc.

* I can either be very talkative or not at all.

* I prefer solitude over big crowds, but I'm not a complete introvert.
